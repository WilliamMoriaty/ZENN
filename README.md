Schematic of ZENN and its applications in different areas. Zentropy theory integrates statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics by assigning intrinsic entropy to each system component, thereby capturing internal disparities. By embedding zentropy theory into deep learning as a backward modeling framework, ZENN replaces the internal energy E^((k)) and S^((k)) of each configuration with simple neural networks, and integrates information across all configurations through the total free energy F. In this paper, ZENN has been applied in three representative tasks—multi-source data integration, energy landscape reconstruction, and inference of Fe₃Pt alloy properties—demonstrating its potential as a powerful framework that effectively bridges statistical mechanics and machine learning.
